# Creating the first scene

We're going to add the first scene to the game. Yaeger supports two different
types of scenes. A `StaticScene` and a `DynamicScene`. A `StaticScene` will have
no Game World Update (GWU) and should be used for scenes in which nothing 
should move or be animated. A `DynamicScene` does receive a GWU and should be
used for Game Levels, or scenes that contain animated elements. Since nothing
will have to be animated for the Title scene, it can be a `StaticScene`.

## Add the title scene

![Edit](images/edit.png) Create a new Class called `TitleScene` that
extends `StaticScene` in the package `com.github.hanyaeger.tutorial.scenes`.
Implement the required methods, but leave them empty.

## Set the background image and audio

The method `setupScene()` should be used for setting the background image and
audio of a scene. For this you can use the methods 
`setBackgroundImage(String)` and `setBackgroundAudio(String)`.

Both the image and the audio are provided in the `resources/` folder. This
folder should be the only location to store your assets. The url is relative to
this folder, so the file `background1.jpg` from the folder `backgrounds/` should
be accessed through the url `backgrounds/background1.jpg`. For the background
audio, we will use `ocean.mp3`.

![Edit](images/edit.png) Add the following body to the `setupScene()`.

```java
@Override
public void setupScene(){
    setBackgroundAudio("audio/ocean.mp3");
    setBackgroundImage("backgrounds/background1.jpg");
}
```

At this point you should have a look at the file `module-info.java`, which is
called the [Module Descriptor](https://www.oracle.com/nl/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html). 
This is a special file that defines (amongst other things) which directories 
should be opened up. The `resources` folder itself is open by default, but 
any subdirectory should be added for the resources in those directories to 
be available. As you will notice this has already been done:

```java 
opens audio; 
opens backgrounds; 
opens sprites;
```

Do not forget to do this for your own game, or an Exception will be thrown when
the game is trying to access a resource that is in a directory that has not been
opened up.

## Add the `TitleScene` to the Yaeger game

Now that we have created the `TitleScene`, we should add it to the Game. For 
this, we will use the method `addScene(int, YaegerScene)` from `Waterworld.
java`. This method should be called from `setupScenes()` and takes two 
parameters. The first one identifies the scene, which you can 
use to set the active scene. The second parameter is an instance of the scene.

![Edit](images/edit.png) So add the following body to the `setupScenes()`
method:

```java
@Override
public void setupScenes(){
    addScene(0, new TitleScene());
}
```

![Run](images/play.png) It's time to run the game again. After the Splash Screen
has been shown, the `TitleScene` should be loaded.

## Add some text to the `TitleScene`

Let's add the title of the game to the `TitleScene`. All objects you can add to
a scene are called *Entities*. Of these there are various different types. There
are *TextEntities* that should be used for displaying text, *SpriteEntities* 
for displaying a Sprite and shape-based Entities, such as a 
*RectangleEntity*. For all these types there are the Static and
Dynamic version.

A title is typically the static version of a `TextEntity`. We will use the
method `setupEntities()` to add Entities to the scene.

![Edit](images/edit.png) Add the following body to the `setupEntities()` method:

```java
@Override
public void setupEntities(){

    var waterworldText = new TextEntity(
        new Coordinate2D(getWidth() / 2, getHeight() / 2),
        "Waterworld"
    );
    waterworldText.setAnchorPoint(AnchorPoint.CENTER_CENTER);
    waterworldText.setFill(Color.DARKBLUE);
    waterworldText.setFont(Font.font("Roboto", FontWeight.SEMI_BOLD, 80));
    addEntity(waterworldText);
}
```

![The Title Scene](images/game/title-no-buttons.png)

First we create the `waterworldText` by instantiating a `TextEntity`. The first
parameter of the constructor is the `Coordinate2D`. To place it at the center of
the scene, we use the `getWidth()/2` and `getHeight()/2`. The second parameter
is the text to be shown. To actually place the center of the `TextEntity` at the
center of the scene, we use the method `setAnchorPoint()`. To set the color,
we use `setFill()`. We set the font to Roboto, through the
method `setFont()` and lastly we add the `TextEntity` to the scene, by 
calling the method `addEntity()`.

![Run](images/play.png) Run the game again. The `TitleScene` should now contain
the title.
