# Introduction

In this tutorial you will create a simple game called Waterworld. We will start
with an empty project. Only the assets and the project settings are provided. 
You will be guided Step-by-step in the creation of a simple game, and in doing 
so, become familiar with many of the features of Yaeger.

## What we will be building

When this tutorial is completed, we will have a game in which a fish (called 
Hanny) has to navigate through the ocean and pop air bubbles. While doing so,
she has to prevent being bitten by enemies that also prowl the ocean.

## Prerequisite

Yaeger requires Java JDK16 or above to work. Although it can be used with any 
modern IDE that supports Java, this tutorial will only include examples for
[JetBrains IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and 
[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/).

This tutorial expects a basic understanding of the Java Programming language.
From Java, we will only be using the basic constructs, such as packages, 
classes, interfaces and methods. More "modern" parts of the language, such 
as lambda's or generics are not required, nor used.
